### ðŸ¤– AI Usage Note

AI tools were used throughout the development of Planish to **accelerate repetitive coding tasks**.

However, all **core decisions, customization, and design** of the app's experience were made intentionally by the Developer. AI supported productivity, not creativity or decision-making.
